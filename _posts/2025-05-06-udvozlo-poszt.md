Ez az els≈ë blogposztom! üéâ  
Ezent√∫l itt fogom megosztani a kutat√°saimat, gondolataimat √©s h√≠reket.

I was invited as a Plenary speaker at P√°linka konferencia in 2022, where I presented the opportunities in the applications of novel consumer sensory methods in p√°linka sensory analysis. The lecture introduced some of the latest restuls we achieved with students enrolled to the P√°linka szakm√©rn√∂ki course of MATE university. It has been proved that p√°linka consumers are willing to attend on consumer sensory tests and the latest methods, such as check-all-that apply analyses, preference mapping or even modeling give valuable information to p√°linka makers to meet the expectations of consumers.
